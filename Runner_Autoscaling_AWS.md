# GitLab Runner Autoscaling Using AWS EC2 Instances

## Overview:
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on implementing GitLab Runner autoscaling using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. GitLab Runner autoscaling optimizes resource utilization and reduces costs by dynamically provisioning and terminating EC2 instances based on the workload. This guide covers the setup, configuration, and best practices for achieving efficient and flexible GitLab CI/CD pipelines through autoscaling with AWS EC2 instances.


## Introduction

GitLab Runner, a key component of GitLab's CI/CD toolset, executes tasks defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml` files, streamlining development workflows. However, as project demands vary, static resources can lead to inefficiencies.GitLab Runner autoscaling using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances solves this challenge. By dynamically provisioning and terminating EC2 instances based on workload, GitLab Runner can adapt to varying demands efficiently.

### Advantages

- **Optimized Costs:** Autoscaling ensures resources are allocated only when needed, reducing expenses.
- **Flexibility:** Resources automatically adjust to demand, maintaining performance during peaks.
- **Scalability:** The system grows or shrinks in response to changes, maintaining responsiveness.
- **Resource Utilization:** Efficiently utilizes resources to avoid waste.
- **Swift Deployment:** Quick provisioning of instances accelerates deployment times.

## Prerequisites

To implement GitLab Runner autoscaling using AWS EC2, you'll need:

- A GitLab account for CI/CD management.
- An AWS account to leverage EC2 resources.
- An AWS IAM user with necessary permissions.

## Private GitLab server setup

For the project, a private GitLab server has been established. The GitLab server has been provisioned in an Ubuntu machine and for installation, GitLab official installation [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/installation/) is followed.

## AWS IAM user configuration

To spin up new runner instances in AWS an IAM user access is need to GitLab server. In order to do that an IAM user is created  
## Setting Up GitLab Runner Autoscaling

Configuring GitLab Runner to enable autoscaling involves several steps:

1. Install and configure GitLab Runner on your system.
2. Choose AWS EC2 as the executor for autoscaling.
3. Define the autoscaling strategy and parameters.

### Step 1: Install and Configure GitLab Runner

Install GitLab Runner on your machine and configure it with your GitLab account credentials.

### Step 2: Choose AWS EC2 as the Executor

In your GitLab Runner configuration file (`config.toml`), set the executor to `docker+machine` to enable autoscaling using Docker Machine.

### Step 3: Define Autoscaling Strategy

Configure the autoscaling strategy based on your project's requirements. Set thresholds for scaling up or down and specify the instance types to use.

By following these steps, you'll have GitLab Runner autoscaling with AWS EC2 instances up and running, ready to optimize your CI/CD pipelines dynamically.
